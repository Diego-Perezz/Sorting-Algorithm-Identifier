# Sorting Algorithm Identifier

This Python project identifies unknown sorting algorithms from a corrupted software package by analyzing their performance. It tests each algorithm on different input lists and measures time complexity and memory usage to match them with known sorting algorithms.

## Summary
- Benchmarks each sorting algorithm with custom input cases.
- Analyzes time and memory performance to differentiate algorithms.
- Identifies nÂ² sorts (Bubble, Selection, Insertion), QuickSort variants, and more.
